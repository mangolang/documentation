Quick intro
===============================

Great programmers should use great tools! Writing bug-free software is hard, but Mango is a language that has your back:

* Prevent mistakes with a strong, static type system
* Write composable code using immutability by default
* Prevent data races using ownership (affine types)
* Never forget to handle errors or clean up resources with linear types
* Describe state precisely through non-nullabiity and sum types
* Trust your invariants with easy enforcement
* Catch errors early by doing things compile-time when possible

(These are planned features and are subject to change.)

The guiding principle is that you should be able to reason about small parts of code, because Mango pushes your colleagues towards good design, and there are many invariants that you can rely on.
